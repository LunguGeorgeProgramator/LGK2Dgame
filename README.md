# How to build a windows exe ?

Run the following commands to build the project and generate the `.exe`

```
./gradlew clean build
./gradlew launch4j
```
The generated executable will be located at:
````
LGK2Dgame/build/home/georgel/IdeaProjects/LGK2Dgame/build/exe/LGK2DGame.exe
````
For convenience, I've also included a pre-built `.exe`

⚠️ If you prefer not to run the included `.exe` , feel free to build it yourself using the commands above.
