# How to build a windows exe ?

Run command as bellow the exe file will be on project path added also bellow:

```
./gradlew clean build
 ./gradlew launch4j
```

````
LGK2Dgame/build/home/georgel/IdeaProjects/LGK2Dgame/build/exe/LGK2DGame.exe
````

But for quicker use, I added the exe inside the root folder for this project.
If you are scared do not open it build it your self with above commands.
